AMBIEN*t



About:

AMBIEN*t is a game for insomniacs, a stripped down, vibey version of Breakout. It is experiential, not competitive. It's for those who lie in bed, in the dark, at 4am, dying to sleep, wanting something to do that is not too stimulating or cerebral. Something ambient and soothing. The goal is to keep the ball moving by tracking it with the paddle. But truly, the goal is to zone out and fall asleep as a result of prolonged exposure to the somewhat trippy visuals and moody looped music, eye fatigue, and even boredom. 



User Stories: 

-The player is presented with instructions and presses OK to confirm they've been read and that the game can now begin.
-Once the ball launches, the goal is to move the paddle around and have the ball bounce off of it instead of hitting the bottom of the rectangular game frame. The game goes on and on until the player miss the ball.
-Once the player loses, they are notified of their loss and they can press ok to reload the game.



Technologies:
HTML, CSS, HTML Canvas, Javascript, JQuery.



Problems:
I am currently working on the spacebar's relationship to the ball's movements. I had originally constructed the game without using HTML Canvas but I eventually realized that one must use the best tool for the job. So I have much building left to do.




Things I would like to do:

-Have multiple rounds, where the speed of the ball is increased per round.
-New background image with each new round.
-New song with each new round.
-Have initial ball state be at rest and connect ball movement to spacebar. So user has start/stop control.
-Have a cancel option in the end of game modal, so the page doesn't reload and just stays as is.
